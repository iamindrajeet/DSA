The composite pattern is meant to allow treating individual objects and compositions of objects, or “composites” in the same way. 

It can be viewed as a tree structure made up of types that inherit a base type, and it can represent a single part or a whole hierarchy of objects.

We can break the pattern down into:

1.component – is the base interface for all the objects in the composition. It should be either an interface or an 
	abstract class with the common methods to manage the child composites.
2.leaf – implements the default behavior of the base component. It doesn’t contain a reference to the other objects.
3.composite – has leaf elements. It implements the base component methods and defines the child-related operations.
4.client – has access to the composition elements by using the base component object.
