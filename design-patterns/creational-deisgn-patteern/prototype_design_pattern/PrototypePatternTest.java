/*
 * 
 * 
 * Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and 
 * resources and you have a similar object already existing. Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the 
 * original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype design pattern uses java 
 * cloning to copy the object.

	Prototype Design Pattern Example
	It would be easy to understand prototype design pattern with an example. 
	Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database. Now we need to modify this data in our program 
	multiple times, so itâ€™s not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load all the data again 
	from database. The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and then do the 
	data manipulation. Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the 
	copying feature. It should not be done by any other class. However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the 
	Object properties depends on the requirements and its a design decision. Here is a sample program showing 
	Prototype design pattern example in java. Employees.java
 */

public class PrototypePatternTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
		Employees emps = new Employees();
		emps.loadData();

		// Use the clone method to get the Employee object
		Employees empsNew = (Employees) emps.clone();
		Employees empsNew1 = (Employees) emps.clone();

		List<String> list = empsNew.getEmpList();
		list.add("John");
		List<String> list1 = empsNew1.getEmpList();
		list1.add("Pankaj");

		System.out.println("emps List: " + emps.getEmpList());
		System.out.println("empsNew List: " + list);
		System.out.println("empsNew1 List: " + list1);
